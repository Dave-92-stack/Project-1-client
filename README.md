## Planning & Development
--------------------------

This project is the first assessment for my Software Engineering Immersive at General Assembly; marking it as my first mile stone in learning how to write code. When it was assigned our instructors advised the cohort to take measured steps in creating the project, warning against tackling it as a whole. This was sound advice that fell upon deaf ears.

I started, like most of my fellows, by creating basic wireframes to map how the application should look. Admitabbly they were rather simple designs but, provided a basic foundation to build from. I also reviewed the requirements for the project and linked them closely with the programming term "user stories". This would allow me to quickly reference what was needed for my code to meet its predetermined goals.

Once the actual coding I started by doing the user authentication process first as, it was the most recent topic covered in the course. Fresh in my mind I was able to produce, what I assumed to be, a working authentication process within the first hour. Imagine my shock when I finally tried to test it and found an error. After nearly 3 hours of searching for two spelling mistakes I would learn exactly what my professors meant.

From then on I'd test every function and every change I made to my code. My pace dropped considerably but I never encountered an issue like that again. The closest being when I had to write the game's logic which turned into a considerable if else statement.

## User Stories
---------------

* As a new user I want to create and sign into my account.
* As an existing user I want to be able to change my password.
* As a player I want to be able to place peaces on the board.
* As a player I want to know if someone wins, looses, or ties.
* As an existing user I want to see how many games I've played.

## Unsolved Problems
--------------------

* Create a simple AI so that a user can play by themselves.
* Improve user experience as starting a game can be finicky.
* Add additional CSS to make over all product cleaner and more presentable.
* Add a win, loose, and tie counter.
